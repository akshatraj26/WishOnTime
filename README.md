## Email Configuration

To configure the email backend, add the following settings to your `settings.py` file:

```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'  # or the SMTP server you're using
EMAIL_PORT = 587  # or the correct port for your SMTP provider
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'akshatraj2607@gmail.com'  # Your email address
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-app-password'  # Your email password or app password

DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = EMAIL_HOST_USER
```

### Creating an App Password for Gmail SMTP

If you are using Gmail, you need to generate an app password to use for the `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` instead of your regular Google account password. Hereâ€™s how you can create one:

1. **Enable 2-Step Verification:**
   - Go to your Google account: [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/)
   - Under **Security**, turn on **2-Step Verification**.
   
2. **Generate an App Password:**
   - After enabling 2-Step Verification, go to the **App Passwords** section under **Security**.
   - Select **Mail** as the app and **Other** as the device, then give it a name (e.g., "Django App").
   - Click **Generate**, and Google will give you a 16-character password.
   - Use this password for the `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` in your `settings.py`.

## Database Migrations

To set up the database:

1. **Make Migrations**

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   ```

2. **Apply Migrations**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the Development Server**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. Visit the application in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

3. Use the navigation bar to add, view, and manage scheduled birthdays.
